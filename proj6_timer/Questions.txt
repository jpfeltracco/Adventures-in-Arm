Time = Init_Val / (4,000,000 / 8)
1.  I would set the systick reload value to 100 * (4,000,000 / 8) = 0x2FAF080
    i.e. instead of mov r1, #0x100000, do ldr r1, =0x2FAF080
2.  It is used to select between two clock sources, AHB or a prescaled
    by 8 version AHB/8.
3.  The processor would get interrupted so quickly the main code of the
    program may not have time to execute properly.
