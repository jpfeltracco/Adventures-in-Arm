Period = Init_Val / (4,000,000 / 8)
2.1
1.  I would set the systick reload value to value to
    (1 / 100) * (4,000,000 / 8) = 5,000.
    i.e. instead of mov r1, #0x100000, do ldr r1, =5,000
2.  It is used to select between two clock sources, AHB or a prescaled
    by 8 version AHB/8. A 1 bit denotes the processor clock (non-prescaled) and
    the 0 bit denotes processor clock / 8.
3.  The processor would get interrupted so quickly the main code of the
    program may not have time to execute properly.
2.2
1.  The crystal-controlled oscillator is much more stable than the internal
    RC oscillator.
2.  Since our prescalar before was x6 (which gets divided by 2) in order to
    get 8 x 3 = 24 Mhz scaling, we can instead use a scalar of x12 because
    4 * 12 / 2 = 24 Mhz. Specifically we would store 0b1010 in the PLLMUL
    bits, ie ldr r1, =0x280000, and store r1 in RCC->cfgr.
3.  The lights would blink more quickly as the faster clock rate would speed
    up all instructions. The basic functionality and timing the button
    presses would all still be correct however.
4.  (((8 Mhz / 2) * 2) / 16) / 512 = approximately 977 Hz.
